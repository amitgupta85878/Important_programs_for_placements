Object Oriented Programming In Java Questions And Answers

1. What is OOPs? 
OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming system. It is a 
programming paradigm in which software design involves 
around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. In OOPs, 
objects are data fields that have unique attributes and properties. 
OOPs focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate 
rather than the logic required to manipulate them. That's why large, 
complex and actively updated or maintained program is well suited 
for OOPs paradigm of programming. 

2. What are the basic features of OOPs? 
Following are the basic features of OOPs - 
• Abstraction 
• Encapsulation 
• Inheritance 
• Polymorphism 

3. Why use OOPs? 
OOPs provide the following advantages, that's why it is used. 
• Code maintenance 
• Reusability 
• Security 
• Better productivity 
• Polymorphism flexibility 
• Problem solving 
• Easy troubleshooting 
• Design benefits 
• Data redundancy

4.What are the difference between OOP and SOP? 
OOP SOP
1. It stands for Object-Oriented 
Programming.
It stands for Structural 
Oriented Programming.
2. It is based on objects. It is based on functions.
3. It follows Bottom-up 
programming approach.
It follows Top-down 
programming approach.
4. It is based on real world. It is based on unreal world.
5. It provides data hiding so it 
is very secure.
It doesn't provide data hiding 
so it is less secure.
6. It provides reusability 
feature.
It doesn't provide reusability 
feature.
7. Eg. C++, Java, python etc. Eg. C, Pascal, Basic etc.

5. What is a class? 
A class is a collection of objects. Classes don’t consume 
any space in the memory. 
It is a user defined data type that act as a template for 
creating objects of the identical type. 

Once a class has been defined. A large number of objects 
can be created using the same class. Therefore, Class is 
considered as the blueprint for the object. 
For eg. Fruit is a class and its objects are mango, apple 
etc. Furniture is a class and its objects are table, chair, 
desk etc. 
Syntax :
class classname [extends inheritance] 
{ 
 [field declararion] 
 [method declaration] 
} 

6.What is an object? 
An object is a real world entity which have properties and 
functionalities. 
Object is also called an instance of class. Objects take 
some space in memory. 
For eg. car, table, chair etc. are the example of objects. 
Syntax of creation of object : 

classname obj_reference = new classname(); 
 OR 
Step I - classname obj_reference; // object declararion 
Step II - obj_reference = new classname(); //object 
initialization 

7. What is the difference between a class and an object? 
Class Object
1. It is a collection of objects. It is an instance of a class.
2. It doesn't take up space in 
memory.
It takes space in memory.
3. Class does not exist 
physically
Object exist physically.
4. Classes are declared just 
once
Objects can be declared as and 
when required
5. Eg. - Fruit, Vehicle, Laptop Eg. - Mango, Car, HP Laptop 

8.What is the difference between a class and a structure? 
Class Structure
1. Class is a collection of 
objects.
Structure is a collection of 
variables of different data 
types under a single unit
2. Class is used to combine 
data and methods together.
Structure is used to grouping 
data.
3. Class's objects are created on 
the heap memory.
Structure's objects are created 
on the stack memory.
4. A class can inherit another 
class.
A structure can't inherit 
another structure.
5. A class has all members 
private by default
A structure has all members 
public by default
6. Classes are ideal for larger or 
complex objects
Structures are ideal for small 
and isolated model objects

9. What is encapsulation? 
Encapsulation is an striking feature of OOPs that provides 
data security. It is a mechanism of binding member data
and member function together into a single place i.e. class. 
The main advantage of encapsulation is that data is hidden 
and protected from access by outside non-member 
methods of a class. In other words, only member 
functions defined in a class will have access to the data.
In encapsulation, data(variables) are declared as private 
and methods are declared as public. 

10. What are access specifiers? 
Access specifiers are the most important part of object 
oriented programming paradigm. It allows us to restrict
the scope or visibility of a package, class, constructor, 
methods, variables, or other data members. 
By using access specifiers, we define how the members 
(attributes and methods) of a class can be accessed. 
There are three types of most common access specifiers, 
which are following. 
• Private 
• Public 
• Protected
